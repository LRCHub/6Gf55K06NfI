[00:06.56] Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
[00:15.31] Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
[00:21.78] Loving him is like trying to change your mind
[00:24.53] Once you're already flying through the free fall
[00:30.46] Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all
[01:03.46] 
[00:37.57] Losing him was blue like I'd never known
[00:41.32] Missing him was dark gray, all alone
[00:45.09] Forgetting him was like tryin' know somebody you never met
[00:53.04] But loving him was red
[01:04.04] 
[01:00.82] Loving him was red
[01:09.82] 
[01:07.88] Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
[01:11.53] Was right there in front of you
[01:15.23] Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words
[01:19.15] To your old favorite song
[01:31.65] 
[01:22.83] Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
[01:26.39] And realizing there's no right answer
[01:31.09] Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
[01:34.70] That love could be that strong
[01:49.70] 
[01:39.17] Losing him was blue like I'd never known
[01:43.06] Missing him was dark gray, all alone
[01:46.84] Forgetting him was like tryin' know somebody you never met
[01:54.34] But loving him was red
[01:58.05] Oh, red
[02:02.23] Burning red
[02:07.73] 
[02:08.88] Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
[02:13.59] Tell myself, "It's time now, gotta let go"
[02:17.10] But moving on from him is impossible
[02:20.04] When I still see it all in my head
[02:24.80] In burning red
[02:31.80] 
[02:32.78] Loving him was red
[02:41.78] 
[02:39.77] Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
[02:44.28] Missing him was dark gray, all alone
[02:47.87] Forgetting him was like tryin' to know
[02:50.33] Somebody you never met
[02:55.60] 'Cause loving him was red
[02:58.33] Yeah, yeah, red
[03:03.30] We're burning red
[03:11.80] 
[03:11.53] And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
[03:16.34] Comes back to me, burning red
[03:21.14] Yeah, yeah
[03:26.34] His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
