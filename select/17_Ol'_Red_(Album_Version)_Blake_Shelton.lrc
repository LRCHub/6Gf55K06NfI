[00:14.35] Well I caught my wife with another man
[00:17.37] And it cost me ninety nine
[00:22.21] On a prison farm in Georgia
[00:25.68] Close to the Florida line
[00:30.27] Well I'd been here for 2 long years
[00:33.29] I finally made the warden my friend
[00:37.51] And so he sentenced me to a life of ease
[00:41.50] Taking care of Ol Red
[00:52.00] 
[00:46.12] Now Ol' Red he's the damnedest dog that I've ever seen
[00:54.29] Got a nose that can smell a two day trail
[00:57.46] He's a four legged tracking machine
[01:02.22] You can consider yourself mighty lucky
[01:04.83] To get past the gators and the quicksand beds
[01:10.25] But all these years that I've been here
[01:13.50] Ain't nobody got past Red
[01:26.00] 
[01:17.51] And the warden sang
[01:18.55] Come on somebody
[01:20.01] Why don't you run
[01:21.54] Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
[01:25.02] Get my lantern
[01:26.47] Get my gun
[01:28.01] Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
[01:51.01] 
[01:36.73] Well I paid off the guard and I slipped out a letter
[01:39.82] To my cousin up in Tennessee
[01:44.33] Oh and he brought down a blue tick hound
[01:47.71] She was pretty as she could be
[01:52.34] Well they penned her up in the swampland
[01:55.68] 'Bout a mile just south of the gate
[02:00.60] And I'd take Ol' Red for his evening run
[02:03.88] I'd just drop him off and wait
[02:18.88] 
[02:08.08] And the warden sang
[02:08.95] Come on somebody
[02:10.44] Why don't you run
[02:11.99] Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
[02:15.15] Get my lantern
[02:16.71] Get my gun
[02:18.39] Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
[02:41.39] 
[02:33.55] Now Ol' Red got real used to seeing
[02:36.52] His lady every night
[02:41.52] And so I kept him away for three or four days
[02:45.04] And waited till the time got right
[02:49.28] Well I made my run with the evenin' sun
[02:52.54] And I smiled when I heard 'em turn Red out
[02:57.48] 'Cause I was headed north to Tennessee
[03:00.34] And Ol' Red was headed south
[03:14.34] 
[03:04.64] And the warden sang
[03:05.89] Come on somebody
[03:07.19] Why don't you run
[03:08.85] Ol' Red's itchin' to have a little fun
[03:11.94] Get my lantern
[03:13.51] Get my gun
[03:15.13] Red'll have you treed before the mornin' comes
[03:38.13] 
[03:20.46] Now there's red haired blue ticks all in the South
[03:24.05] Love got me in here and love got me out
