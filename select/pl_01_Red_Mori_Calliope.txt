Tonight, the moon has rose in a crimson red
But roses gotta wither, so I'll live forever
instead
And now I can't get rid of all of these thorns
in my head
Bring on the hemorrhaging
I guess I'll live inside your memory
Another distorted story that ignored the
deceased
I'll live inside of a castle, pray I'm never
released
I'd rather kick it in the dungeon, cuz I'm that
kind of beast
I'll bet my heart on the cards, because I trust
me the least
(Let it die)
Pressure mounting, but I'm doomed without it
Precious moments zooming by, don't doubt it
Rest is ephemeral, scream and shout it
The best don't sleep, I was all about it but
(Let it die)
Reaping keeps you tucked in the shadows
This creeping feeling of identity battles
Closing in from every side of me.
Red tomorrow, Red today
Dread, sorrow,
Can't turn away
Can't turn back
Time, I'll always be
A prisoner to my ambition
As petals fly, I'll dance your tune but hold
your breath,
guess who's running the show?
And when this red runs black, I'll ask you
Was I everything you imagined?
When my time's finally up, the sun's falling
down
I'll turn to stone again.
Every day is a fight to stay relevant
And it cannot last, so I'll relish it
And our planet's vast, but this hole's a ditch
Ya toss out the past, and you can strike it rich
Nobody asked, but the mask is an alright fit
And this fiction's no disaster, in spite of it
I stay curious. What comes after it.
So mysterious, and yet, I exist.
Hold on, stay beautiful, stay young
There are blades to be swung yet
Rising soon, regard the moon reflected in the
crimson sung tonight...
Red tomorrow, Red today
Dread, sorrow,
Can't turn away
Can't turn back
Time, I'll always be
A prisoner to my ambition
As petals fly, I'll dance your tune but hold
your breath,
guess who's owning the throne?
So, come alive now
Once again, so I can chase you down
We are five minutes away from
The end that's come
Continue slashing forward, I must
Or else just
Fade away...
There's a drive to strive inside all of us
A never-ending ouroboros
Sinking way deep down and it's all because
I kept thinking that reaping is all there was
And is now
I gotta find a way out, escape, how?
Fate has a funny way of shaking the weak down
Am I gonna peak now? Future looking bleak, wow
Somehow incomplete, after all.
Can't. Turn. Back.
Time, I'll always be
A prisoner to my ambition
As petals fly, I'll dance your tune, don't hold
your breath for me
And when this red runs black, I'll ask you
Was I everything you imagined?
When my time's finally up, the sun's falling
down
I'll turn to stone again.
So, come alive now
Once again, so I can chase you down
We are five seconds away from
The end that's come
From here on out it's only just,
Me and this bloodlust
I'd rather just
Fade away...
